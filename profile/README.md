# 👋 Oh, hello there...

We’re **Oddbit**, a software development agency based in Bali — building digital products and long-term partnerships with clients across the world.  

We’re a **tight, cross-functional unit** of engineers, designers, and problem solvers who care deeply about what we build and the people we build it with.  
We don’t just write code — we solve problems, translate ideas into scalable systems, and help businesses grow through clarity and craftsmanship.

> “We create better solutions — together.”

## 🧭 What We Do

- **Technical Architecture & System Design** – building strong, scalable foundations  
- **Full-Stack Development & Maintenance** – reliable engineering across platforms  
- **Rapid Prototyping & Validation** – move fast, learn early, and iterate well  
- **UX / UI & Brand Strategy** – connect users with clear design and purpose  
- **Workshops & Discovery** – align goals, define your MVP, and get started right  

We’re technology-agnostic and fluent in AWS, Azure, JavaScript, TypeScript, Flutter, and more.  
But above all, we speak **clarity**, **ownership**, and **commitment**.
